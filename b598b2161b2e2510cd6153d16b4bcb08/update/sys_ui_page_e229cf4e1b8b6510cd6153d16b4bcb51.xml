	<p>Welcome to R-IDE - created and maintained by&#160;<a href="mailto:sascha.wildgrube@servicenow.com">Sascha Wildgrube</a>.</p>

	<h2>Overview</h2>  
	<g2:no_escape>$[
		docapi.RenderDescription();
	]</g2:no_escape>
	
	<h2>Features</h2> 
	<p>R-IDE is an integrated development environment - a tool for pro-coders to build and maintain custom applications.</p>
	<p>R-IDE shows and navigates to all application files contained in an application. These files are displayed as tabs (like in classic and ServiceNow Studio). When loading the same app again the previously open tabs are restored for each user and application - so picking up work where you left it is super-convenient.</p>
	<p>R-IDE is built with pro-coders in mind who prefer to use and see technical names rather than display names.</p>
	<p>R-IDE navigates to application files by their related table, by their class type and by their name.</p>
	<p>R-IDE helps to navigate to important platform tools, capabilities and documentation needed to create custom applications.</p>
	<p>R-IDE can create new applications.</p>
	<p>R-IDE can commit all uncommitted files to the current source control branch.</p>
	<p>R-IDE is yet a work-in-progress project. Some crucial features like most source control operations or code search are not yet fully implemented - so as of now R-IDE has to send you to classic Studio to perform some activities.</p>

	<h2>But why?</h2>
	<p>Shortly before the first release of R-IDE the new ServiceNow Studio was released. ServiceNow Studio aims at replacing the classic Studio, App Engine Studio and various other isolated builder tools on the platform. So who needs R-IDE anyway?</p>
	<p>There is never a single tool that will meet the demands (and the taste) of everyone. So having multiple options to choose from is a value in itself. Further, competition sometimes boosts quality and motivates everyone to build the even better product.</p>
	<p>The work on R-IDE (then called "ServiceNow IDE" - a name now occupied by the official ServiceNow IDE) started back in May 2023. It was clear for years that the classic Studio would not receive the love it needed. R-IDE was the perfect showcase for a React-based user interface. The Reactor app - which was built to demonstrate how React can be used to create stunning user interfaces on the ServiceNow platform - was initially released in September 2022 - but it yet required a relevant use case to show its real potential.</p>
	<p>Rebuilding all the capabilities of the classic Studio (and adding even more) is not a project for a single weekend - so it took some time to reach a state in which using R-IDE finally became more efficient for day-to-day development work than classic Studio.</p>
	<p>With the release of ServiceNow Studio in late 2024 a decision had to be made. Keep the work in its then unfinished state or add the missing bits for a real MVP that would not have to shy away from being compared to either classic Studio or the new ServiceNow Studio.</p>
	<p>It's now up to the ServiceNow community to judge whether R-IDE was a waste of time or a great contribution.</p>
	<p>Either way: it was fun to build it :D</p>

	<h2>Release Notes</h2>

	<h3>1.2.0 - TODO</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Reactor 1.12.0 is now required due to the new Columns and ToolStack components.</li>
		<li>Improved layout for creating new Application Files.</li>
		<li>Platform tools and documentation links are moved away from the tool bar to the side bar.</li>
		<li>sys_security_acl, sys_user_role and sys_db_object are now in the usual suspects list and hence displayed as a short cut when creating a new Application File.</li>
		<li>More (secondary) classes are hidden when creating new application files.</li>
		<li>The "R-IDE" link column in the DevTools application page is now placed at the right border.</li> 
		<li>The application's scope is now enforced when loading a form in the tab. E.g. this enables the creation of new sys_choice records for the task.state field in a table derived from task.</li>
		<li>Creating application files now works properly if the user has switched to a different scope and then creates a new application file in R-IDE in a different tab.</li>
		<li>The background script page is now loaded with top and side navigation.</li>
		<li>The "Commit Files" tab is now closed when the commit operations starts.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3>1.1.0 - 2024-12-26</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>DevTools 1.109.0 is now required.</li>
		<li>Reactor 1.11.0 is now required.</li>
		<li>Committing all uncommitted files to the current branch is now supported.</li>
		<li>Creating new applications is now supported.</li>
		<li>The search filter over the tree navigation now has a "Reset Filter" icon button.</li>
		<li>When creating a new application file, the scope for the new file is now set properly.</li>
		<li>When selecting another app the filter is reset.</li>
		<li>More (secondary) classes are hidden when creating new application files.</li>
		<li>The attempt to load a non-existent app is now handled properly.</li>
		<li>Updated documentation and GitHub urls.</li>
	</ol>
